This website showcases my GitHub projects, allowing users to explore my coding journey and see my work in action. You can view a curated list of my repositories, complete with descriptions of each project, the technologies used, and direct links to the source code.

Built with [Angular](https://angular.dev/), HTML, [Tailwind CSS](https://tailwindcss.com/), and the [GitHub API](https://docs.github.com/en/rest), this site features a user-friendly interface that makes navigation a breeze. It's designed for fellow developers, potential employers, and anyone interested in learning more about my projects.

I invite you to explore my work, check out the code on GitHub, and feel free to reach out with any questions or feedback!
